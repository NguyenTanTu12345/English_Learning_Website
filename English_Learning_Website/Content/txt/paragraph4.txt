Snails live on land and in water. A snail’s body is soft. 
It has a head and one long foot. The foot makes a trail of smile. 
A snail moves by gliding along on the slime. 
It can even crawl upside down on its smile. 
All snails have hard shells, too. 
A snail can pull its body inside its shell. 
Then the snail’s soft body is safe.
