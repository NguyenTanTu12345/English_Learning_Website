The teacher rings a bell. 
Ben knows what that bell means. 
It is story time! Ben knows what to do. 
He takes three big steps to the rug. 
He plops down, and he crosses his legs. 
Then he places his hands in his lap. 
Ben smiles at his teacher. 
He is ready for a story. 
Ben thinks story time is the best time.
